# Git-Bisect-Practice

Git Bisect is a tool that can help you find out in which commit a bug was introduced. It is a way to make your investigations faster.
 Using git bisect is a much better way. It's like a little wizard that walks you through recent commits, asks you if they are good or bad, and narrows down the broken commit.
